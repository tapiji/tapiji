 * This interface defines a file-oriented input to an editor.

 * that are the same. The <code>IWorbenchPage.openEditor</code> APIs
 * are dependent on this to find an editor with the same input.

 * File-oriented editors should support this as a valid input type, and allow

 * All editor inputs must implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface;
